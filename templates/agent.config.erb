###########################
#
# This file is used by Navisphere Agent to configure site-specific values.
#
# All entries in this file have this form:
#
# object  value-list
#
# where "object" tells what sort of information is to be configured,
# and "value-list" is a whitespace-separated list of values to be
# configured.  Samples, which should be edited, appear below for all
# permissible types of object.
#
# White space (tabs, space, line-feeds, carriage-returns)
# and blank lines are ignored;
# To continue a line onto the next line, use "\" as
# the last character of that line.  The "\" is dropped
# when the next line is concatenated to the continued line.

#
# Description specification
# -------------------------
#
# The "clarDescr" object takes arbitrary text values intended to
# describe the agent and its location.
#

clarDescr <%= @host_desc %>

#
# The "clarContact" object takes arbitrary text values intended to
# describe who is responsible for the configured agent, and how to
# reach them.
#

clarContact <%= @host_contactname %>, <%= @host_contactphone %>

#
# Device specification
# --------------------
#
# The format of "device" objects for CLARiiON devices is:
# device	device-spec	name	"description"
#
# where the device-spec is the device name to open to access
# the CLARiiON device.  It can be a SCSI-2 file name.  If this is
# "auto", all attached arrays with bound LUNs will be automatically
# configured.  (Currently, dummy arguments are required for name
# and description, when using auto-configuration.)  This can NOT
# be defaulted.
#
# The name is the per-CLARiiON name that can be used to identify each
# CLARiiON to the manager application.  The name is REQUIRED and cannot
# contain spaces (even if surrounded by quotes).  This can NOT
# be defaulted.
#
# The description is a quoted string that contains a brief description
# of the CLARiiON chassis being managed.  It defaults to "" if not
# specified, and to the device name for auto-configuration.
#

# SAMPLES:
#device sga NAVISPHERE-8 "NAVISPHERE-8"
#device sgb NAVISPHERE-1 "NAVISPHERE-1"
#device sgc NAVISPHERE-2 "NAVISPHERE-2"
#device sgd NAVISPHERE-3 "NAVISPHERE-3"
#device sge NAVISPHERE-4 "NAVISPHERE-4"
#device sgf NAVISPHERE-5 "NAVISPHERE-5"
#device sgg NAVISPHERE-6 "NAVISPHERE-6"
#device sgh NAVISPHERE-7 "NAVISPHERE-7"
#device sg0 NAVISPHERE-0 "NAVISPHERE-0"
#device sg1 NAVISPHERE-1 "NAVISPHERE-1"
#device sg2 NAVISPHERE-2 "NAVISPHERE-2"
#device sg3 NAVISPHERE-3 "NAVISPHERE-3"
#device sg4 NAVISPHERE-4 "NAVISPHERE-4"
#device sg5 NAVISPHERE-5 "NAVISPHERE-5"
#device sg6 NAVISPHERE-6 "NAVISPHERE-6"
#device sg7 NAVISPHERE-7 "NAVISPHERE-7"

# automatically detect manageable devices

#
# User Specification.
# ------------------
#
# The format of "user" objects is:
#       user localUserId
# OR
#       user userId@hostname
#
# These build a list of users who are allowed to perform WRITE
# operations to the CLARiiON devices managed by this agent.  By
# default, as specified below, only root on this machine has WRITE
# access.  Others can be granted access by including their login name
# and host which they can access from.  A null list prevents anyone,
# including admin, from having write access.  In order to get write
# access, this file would have to be modified and the Agent stopped
# and restarted to re-read the configuration file, or an appropriate
# remote configuration request would have to be sent to the agent from
# an already-privileged user.
#


user <%= @user_names %>
#user system@<SPA and SPB>
#user sblue@picasso    # individual user "sblue" on host "picasso"
#user lgreen@hannibal  # individual user "lgreen" on host "hannibal"

#
# Poll Specification
# ------------------
#
# The "poll" object takes a numerical count of seconds.
#
# This specifies how often the agent solicits information from the
# array, rather than using cached information.  The minimum is "10".
#

poll <%= @poll_rate %>

#
# Eventlog Specification
# ----------------------
#
# The eventlog object takes a numerical count of log entries.
#
# This defines the maximum number of SP log events received by the
# agent on startup, and received by clients per poll.  A value of 0
# causes the device's entire log to be read at startup.  A minimum
# of 100 events will be read on serial, and 2048 on fibre, overriding
# any lower value configured below.
#

eventlog <%= @event_log %>

#
# Baud Rate Specification
# ----------------------
#
# If the agent is using a serial port to manage a device, the next entry can 
# specify either 9600 baud or 19200 baud.
#

baud <%= @baud_rate %>

#linux currently can't handle this
